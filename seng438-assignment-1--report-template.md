# Introduction

The purpose of this lab was to have an introduction to the software testing
process, and the application Backlog. A Java ATM application was provided 
with two versions (1.0 and 1.1). Once we familiarized ourselves with the application
and Backlog, exploratory testing, manual scripted testing and regression testing
were performed.

Before this lab, we were aware of how exploratory and scripted testing were performed,
but had limited prior experience conducting and documenting testing in a more formal
manner. The exploratory is a more natural form of testing, where realistic scenarios
are performed on the application, and the results compiled. Scripted testing is 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Appendix B of the lab document was read through before creating the exploratory test plan.
From these requirements, we chose the following functions to target:
-On button
-Off button
-Number buttons
-Enter, cancel, clear buttons
-Card verification
-PIN verification
-Initial balance settings
-Withdrawals
-Deposits
-Receipt output
-Log output

From these functions, we divided the work into customer and operator components,
and created more specific tests:

Customer
-Functionality of both cards
-Withdrawals made in varying amounts, from each account
-Deposits made in varying amounts, to each account
-Transfers made in varying amounts between all combinations of accounts
-Balance inquiries made for each account
-Output of receipt terminal
-Button functionality

Operator
-Start servicing of customers
-Stop servicing of customers
-Verification and entry of cash in machine
-Handling of insufficient funds
-Log output
-Boundary conditions of PIN entry

Due to the large number of sequences in which these functions can be performed,
we performed exploratory testing in the small for this application.
